# tiny-can
## If you would like a tiny-can PCB feel free to contact me on Twitter @mintynet, I will send if you cover the cost of postage.
<br>This repository has the arduino code for use with tiny-can PCBs.
<br>This was created as a cheap device for people to get into car hacking, it is based on the new Attiny1614 microcontroller which has hardware SPI to connect to the MCP2515 CAN transceiver, it also uses the SN65HVD230 3,3v CAN transceiver. The ATTINY 0 and 1 series of processors do need programming using three wire UPDI, more details in the link below.<br>

<br>At time of creation the attiny1614 costs about Â£0.60.
# <b>I take no responsibility for any issues caused if using either the hardware or the code</b>
<br><br>Requires the use of the following Arduino library
<br><br>https://github.com/coryjfowler/MCP_CAN_lib
<br><br>The <b>tiny-slcan</b> sketch is slcan compatible software but the serial chip on the arduino boards I use will only run at 500000bps.
<br><br>If you use the following CP2102 serial adapter, pressing H will give you the bash script to allow you to start slcand under linux.

<br>Notes for connecting to OBD2 plug.
<br>CAN L goes to OBD2 pin 14
<br>CAN H goes to OBD2 pin 6
